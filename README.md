## Performance

The performance of this program is closely tied to the speed and bandwidth of your internet connection. A faster and more stable connection allows for quicker and more efficient data crawling, while a slower or less reliable connection can result in slower and potentially incomplete crawling. Additionally, other factors such as the size and complexity of the data being crawled can also impact the program's performance. Therefore, to optimize the program's performance, it is important to ensure a fast and stable internet connection and to carefully consider the scope and complexity of the data being crawled.
